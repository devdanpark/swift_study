# Dictionary
- [Key : data, Key : Data, ...]
- One key connects to one data
- One dictionary key cannot be duplicated. If duplicated, item must be edited, not added. Then, previous data connected to the key value would be removed.
- No limit for data type, however, data type must be the same in one dictionary.
- No order in Dictionary items, but, in Key, there's inner order; therefore, we can use Iterator such as for~ in to search inside of the Dictionary.
- In dictionary, there's no type limit for key, but types must be possible to Hash operations.(Hashable Protocol)
